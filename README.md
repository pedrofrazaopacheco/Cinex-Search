# Intro
The introduction to algorithms and data structures brought me a love for speed and efficiency in programs. To train some of these techniques I present my new project:

Cinex Search

Cinex Search is a software to find the shortest path between two actors. It will then show the movies/series/tv appearances as the bridges.

The datasets were not modified to fit anything and so, a bridge can be an odd talkshow where the two guests appeared. It is not designed to only handle movies so please be aware. The following dataset was downloaded at exactly Sat Apr 15 2023 00:39:51 GMT+0100 (Western European Summer Time). Modifications to it may present unexpected results.

# Installation
The link to the datasets is [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).
Datasets names: **name.basics.tsv.gz**, **title.basics.tsv.gz**, **title.principals.tsv.gz**
Please extract to the following names:
- name.basics.tsv.gz → actors_data.tsv
- title.basics.tsv.gz → titles_data.tsv
- title.principals.tsv.gz → common_data.tsv

Please clone the repo and check out the pdf in the base folder for a better understading of my thought process behind creating and optimizing the program.
